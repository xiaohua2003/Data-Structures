# Data-Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
-  Time Complexity: a way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of the input increases. 
-  Given_array=[1,2,3,4,6,10]
 - type of time complexity: linear time, constant time, quadratic time.
- Linear time: O(n), n is the number of input. T=an+b=O(n) {1. find the fastest growing term  2. Take out the coefficient.} 
- Constant time: O(1)
- Quadratic time: O(n^2). T=cn^2+dn+e
